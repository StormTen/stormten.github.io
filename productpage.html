Upon entering the box the user will be transported to a parallel realm in which they are invisible to all others, giant orange glowing eyes and demonic ghosts excluded. Side effects may include: loss of hair, multiple personality disorder, an unhealthy love for the box, hatred of all who wish to steal your box, and undeath.</p></td>

Guaranteed to go ping in the presence of unstable quarks, the creation of such a box is the magnum opus of our quantum cubic physicists. A lot of effort goes into their creation as it is impossible to know where it is and how fast its corresponding cat is going at the same time. We are not responsible if the box suddenly decides to cease existing.</p></td>

Any object contained inside one box when it is closed will disappear and reappear in the other box. Fantastic for hours of testing entertainment, be warned it does have a tendency to create cake. This confectionary creation is known to be a pathological liar.</p></td>

While we're not entirely sure where he got them, we are pretty confident they are in fact self-contained wormholes, as they are full of countless oddities. Our personal favorites include Arrakis Sandworms, a hovercraft full of eels, a Galactic Travelers Guide, the complete Tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise, the number 42, and all the socks Jim lost to his washing machine over the past decade.</p></td>
